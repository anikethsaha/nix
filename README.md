## What is it and why ?
It solves not a major problem but solves a **problem**.

Whenever you go to your terminal to run a npm script but then you forgot what was the script name or what was its command value which it will run cause you have many scripts.
This package will solve your this problem. Just use this package and it will
- **List all the npm scripts present in your `package.json`**
- **Will also print the equivalent command they will run**
- **Will run the script for you**
**Why?**

Why not !
This is very light weight package. just run on a go.

## Installation
```bash
$ npm i -g runsc
$ runsc # will list the present script then and after selecting, will run it for you

USING NPX
